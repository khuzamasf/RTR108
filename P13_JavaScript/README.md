In this lesson, I learnt and practiced the basics of Javascript. Following are the topics that I have covered in the exercises:
1.	JS Variables:
In this topic, I have learnt to declare variables in Javascript and assign values to variables. Also I have shown output of value of variable on the web by using alert function.
2.	JS Operators:
In this topic, I have learnt about the arithmetic operators commonly used in mathâ€™s such as +, -, /, *. The results of the operation is shown on web using alert function.
3.	JS Datatypes:
In this topic, I have learnt to recognize datatypes in the Javascript.
4.	JS Functions:
In this topic, I have learnt to declare functions and also defining them and calling them.
5.	JS Object:
In this topic, I have learnt to make an object of for example person. The object is declared just like a dictionary.
6.	JS Events:
In this topic, I have learnt to define events in javascript and used events for button which is onclick event.
7.	JS Strings:
In this topic, I have learnt to declarw strings and perform concatenation with two or more strings.
8.	JS String methods:
In this topic, I have been taught about strings slicing and indexing and displaying a specific part of a string using built in functions.
9.	JS Arrays:
In this topic, I have learnt about arrays and how to display length of array and indexing in arrays also.
10.	JS Array methods:
In this topic, I have learnt to assign value to an index of array and remove a specific value from the array on a particular index and also splice function is taught which remove elements in the given range.
11.	JS Array sort:
In this topic, a simple function is used named sort function which is built in and sorts the array in ascending or alphabetic order.
12.	JS Date:
In this topic, date function is used which is built in and a number of its types are used such as displaying month, year, time etc.
13.	JS Math:
In this topic, I have learnt to used math library which us built in in Javascript. Many functions in this library is used such as round off the number, square root of a number etc.
14.	JS Comparisons:
In this topic, a comparison between two variables have been performed such as checking if two variables are equal, greater, lesser or not equal.
15.	JS Conditions:
In this topic, if else and conditions are used to display results such as if the condition is true, then the result is printed and if false, then the result is not printed.
16.	JS Switch:
In this topic, I have done how to use switches and it works on cases that a user input is taken and if a case matches the user input, then that particular case is executed.
17.	JS For Loops:
In this topic, I have used for loops and declared for loop and also print an array inside a for loop index by index.
18.	JS While Loops:
In this topic, I have used while loops and how to declare while loop and also how to Create a condition in while loop.
19.	JS Break Loops:
In this topic, I have learnt about break and continue functions which exits a loop and the other skips an iteration respectively.
20.	JS DOM:
In this topic, I have learnt and practiced document object model which gives access to the tags and elements in an html file which can be then changed using Javascript. This uses built-in functions and is a very important topic to learn.
